```

## Usage

```tsx
import * as React from 'react'

import CFD from 'ag-cumulative-flow'

class Example extends React.Component {
  render () {

    const cumulativeFlowData = {
      Backlog: [{
        x: 1570503600, y: 2
      }],
      Done: [{
        x: 1570417200, y: 1
      }]
    };

    return (
